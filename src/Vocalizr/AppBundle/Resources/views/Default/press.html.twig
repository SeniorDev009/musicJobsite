            <h3>Press Release</h3>
            <h4>Beta Launch</h4>
            
                <p>Vocalists launching their careers are set to benefit in a world-first initiative to connect them with the best in the music industry hierarchy.</p>

                <p>Launched Friday 21 February 2014, Vocalizr (www.vocalizr.com) will connect vocalists around the world with key players in the music industry keen to discover new talent.
                    Through an online database, music producers will be connect with singers looking for a break while vocalists will also be able bid to work on projects that producers
                    are looking for vocalists on.</p>

                <p>Renowned dance music producer and DJ, Luke Chable, who has developed Vocalizr, said today "There has always been a gap in the music industry, making it very difficult 
                    to quickly locate talent. It's an industry that has relied heavily on word-of-mouth but this revolutionary technology takes the chance and
                    luck out of finding the best new talent"</p>

                <p>"Using this technology, a vocalist from Melbourne, Australia could find and work with a producer from London, LA or anywhere in the world without ever meeting
                    each other face-to-face".</p>

                <p>Using key global players in the music industry, Chable developed the groundbreaking website with his brother, Matt and two mystery website developers, and expects to 
                    have more than 50,000 members in its first year. Offering free membership is expected to attract strong interest from both those established
                    in the industry and those seeking to enter it. Within days of launch the Vocalizr site saw activity with members creating 
                    their profiles, uploading samples, posting gigs and submitting bids.</p>

                <p>"Giving people the opportunity to develop a professional online profile means they can present their best to producers. It also means they can hear what interests them
                    the most."</p>

                <p>"We want to help build musical partnerships, and to do that you need to build access to the music industry. I think we've achieved that" Matt Chable said.</p>
